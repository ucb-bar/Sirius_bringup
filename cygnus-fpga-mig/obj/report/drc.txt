REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal mig/island/blackbox/u_nexysvideomig_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the mig/island/blackbox/u_nexysvideomig_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of mig/island/blackbox/u_nexysvideomig_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port uart_rxd expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port uart_txd expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

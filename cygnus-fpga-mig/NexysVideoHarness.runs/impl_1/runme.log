It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1709] Clock output buffering: PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal mig/island/blackbox/u_nexysvideomig_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the mig/island/blackbox/u_nexysvideomig_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of mig/island/blackbox/u_nexysvideomig_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.

# Cygnus bringup

This project serves as PCB bringup for the Cygnus chip taped-out in 2024 Q2. The Cygnus chip is a pair of 4x4 $mm^2$ chiplets on the same package on a 16nm process. The chip is designed to be a low-power, high-performance chip for DSP computing applications, and to showcase scalability of the chiplet architecture for future AI applications.

> **Note**
> 
> The Q2 Cygnus chip is especially confusing for PCB design, since it is a two-chiplet system packaged onto the same Intel UNI interposer. The Quadrant of the die is not one-to-one mapped to the Quadrant of the socket.
> The mapping is described in the later section.

## Test plan

TBD


## Bringup FPGA

2x [Digilent Nexys Video](https://digilent.com/shop/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/)

- $550
- Artix 7
- USB-UART / Ethernet / FT2232 (FTDI USB-FIFO chip, kind of an old part with iffy drivers)
- 512 MiB DDR3
- FMC-LPC (ASP-134603-01), 34x2 pins, Vadj set to 1.2V by default, easy
- Used by Maveric Bringup
- One for each chiplet


## Chiplet-to-Socket Mapping

- Q3 of the socket corresponds to the Golden Triangle (Pin 1 mark)
- Socket quandrant order should look identical as U1

| Socket | Chip     |
| ------ | -------- |
| Q1     | U2 Q3+Q4 |
| Q2     | U1 Q1+Q2 |
| Q3     | U2 Q1+Q2 |
| Q4     | U1 Q3+Q4 |

## Schematic

### Power

| Net    |  Signal Name              | Description              |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| VDD_U1 | Chiplet 1 digital supply  | 0.85 V nominal, generated by bench power supply through banana connector or LDO |
| VDD_U2 | Chiplet 2 digital supply  | 0.85 V nominal, generated by bench power supply through banana connector or LDO |
| IO     | IO cell supply            | 1.2 V, generated by bench power supply through banana connector or LDO |
| VDD_PRE_U1 | Chiplet 1 DDR precharge supply | expected 0.6 V, generated by bench power supply through banana connector |
| VDDQ_U1 | Chiplet 1 DDR PHY supply | expected 1.2 V, generated by bench power supply through banana connector |
| DLL_VINIT_U1 | Chiplet 1 DLL backup supply | boot the DLL in a) case of jumpstarting DLL locking due to false lock conditions and b) booting DLL in case of total system failure |
| DLL_IBIAS_MAIN_U1 | Chiplet 1 DLL analog bias current | This bump is used to supply a bias current to all the circuits in the analog section |
| GND    | Ground                    | Single ground shorted together |

There's two LDOs on board that converts 3.3 V from FMC to 1.2 V and 0.85 V. The LDO is capable of 1A output.


### Clocking

**Core clock (clock_u1, clock_u2)**

- 100 MHz nominal slow clock, driven by external clock generator.
- 1.2 Vpp
- 50 Ohm impedance
- 50R termination resistor near chip socket
- feed in through SMA connector

**PLL refclk (pll_refclk_u1, pll_refclk_u2)**

- 100 MHz nominal input, 1.2 Vpp
- 1.2 Vpp
- 50 Ohm impedance
- 50R termination resistor near chip socket
- feed in through SMA connector

**Debug clock (clk_debug_u1, clk_debug_u1)**

- PLL tap debug clock out, can be muxed to output other clocks
- feed out through 2.54 mm pin header.


### Reset

Chip reset is active high (TODO: confirm this)

Reset can be selected by a pin header jumper to use either button or FMC connection

### JTAG

Low priority low speed signal, route to pin header directly. Use off-board level shifter.

Follows the FT-LINK condensed pin map.

### UART

Configurable pin header selector to route to either 3.3V pin header or 1.2 V FMC.

Using the same level shifter design as Maveric.

### Serial TL

Configurable resistor bank to route to either FMC or debug header. The resistor selectors are by default all placed, so we can monitor FMC traffic through the pin header. 

If signal integrity is a concern, we can remove the pin header selectors manually.

### UCIE Config Bits

Configurable pin header jumper selector to connect to FMC. 

If manual control of the signal voltage is needed, need to use jumper cable to tie signals to either high or low. Since this is configured before chip bootup and will not change during the chip execution, this is fine.

### Chip ID Select

A pin header selector to tie signal high or low.

### DDR Debug

All DDR digital signals broke out to a pin header. This is only present for chip U1.


### FMC Pinout

## PCB Layout

8 layer PCBs

| Index | Layer Name | Purpose    |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1     | L1         | High Speed Signals, DDR + Clock + SerialTL, U1     |
| 2     | L2         | GND        |
| 3     | L3         | Low Speed Signals, U1 + U2     |
| 4     | L4         | GND        |
| 5     | L5         | VDD_IO (polygon/trace) + VDD_core for U2 |
| 6     | L6         | VDD_pre + VDDQ + other DDR |
| 7     | L7         | GND        |
| 8     | L8         | VDD_core for U1 |
| 9     | L9         | GND        |
| 10    | L10        | High Speed Signals, DDR + Clock + SerialTL, U2     |

GND: add stiching between the 4 ground layers

Layout will be done in millimeters (mm)

Regarding JLC layout service: not optimal, since it's priced by pad count, and we have a lot of powers and grounds

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86504560-fe81-4c28-8409-59f4a71c6305)


### Component Placement

FMC indentation is at the bottom, which matches the FPGA.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da2ad535-89ee-487b-97ee-53b2d79084bb)



### Power

For core and IO power, wide trace on top layer to connect pins together, and then via down as much as possible

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/726bd001-fe69-4c2d-8e63-4aea626eed7e)

Decoupling capacitors at the bottom layer, with mechanical clearance to the backplate pattern.

VDD_IO net

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d93ec7ea-30db-445e-bcfa-bfcb095e9b9b)





DDL_IBAS need a narrow trace to connect to pin

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30298153-74fc-4614-93d2-c33a54c7e88c)


### DDR Routing

using calculated 50R trace, 0.186 mm, diff routing to SMA receivers

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5cc49c5-96ef-4be0-984f-30000e65402c)

Due to signal congestion, had to disconnect 1 VDD_IO pin and 2 GND pin.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/702b4ce9-a479-4149-8861-3548e38a4119)

### System Clock Routing

SMA directly to pin, with 50R resistor placed close to socket.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0595b78-fc05-4905-84dc-42db8225caab)

### C2C connect

need to use both L3 and L10 layer

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8371a78b-92db-4ffa-8e30-910db2c93d4c)

### Via Stiching

Entire board is GND stiched with 4mm spacing vias.

### DRC Check

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9bc0c2f-f619-455b-8f68-efbeabc1f78f)

12 DRCs are due to banana connector silkscreen out of board, which is fine.

1 DRC is FMC connector silkscreen too close to the mechanical hole, which is fine.


## Feedback for future chips

Design the bumpmap / interposer with PCB routing in mind! Put high speed signals or nets that require wide traces around the edge of the pin map.
